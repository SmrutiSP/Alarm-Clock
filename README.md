# Alarm-Clock
This is an alarm clock project made using HTML, CSS and JS

# Features:
- User can type any time in the format HH:MM:SS AM/PM and set an alarm at that time.
- User can delete the alarm before its time.
- As the actual time equals the time set in alarm then an alert message is shown on screen and the alarm is deleted from the list of all set alarms.
